# archax

## JHAX cutomized arch
This is a vagrant build of arch, based on the official arch release. I will do my absolute best to keep this updated whenever arch updates things, but I can make no promises

### Purpose
This particluar build is going to be a kali-like distro, but only tools that I use - I have ran into a few issues running kali itself, and blackarch is just way too bloated for me. so.... here we are

### Software
I will put what software I add in addition to a stock arch build here
